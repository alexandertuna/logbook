    - [ ] Global Sync: the two blocks shown are too low-level and not very helpful. The attached would be better, even if incomplete. I’ll make a diagram for you. OCR needs to be defined as Orbit Count Reset, delivered at a specific BCR by the TTC.
    - [ ] I didn’t catch if you explicitly mentioned that the L1A readout is working (with bug) and various tests rely on it, e.g. Slide 14
    - [ ] Slide 15: only 1 fiber connection => only 1 fiber connection per sector
    - [ ] Slide 26: Some pieces ready => Most pieces ready
