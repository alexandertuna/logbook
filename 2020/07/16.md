### Todo

- [x] Improve ART phase calib
  - [x] Put run number in the output
    - [x] https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-muon-nsw-daq/NSWCalibration/-/issues/23
  - [x] Why this boi crash?
    - [x] https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-muon-nsw-daq/NSWCalibration/-/issues/24
    - [x] Crashes on Entry 22200 / 178974
    - [x] (0, 16, 60, 14) <=> (layer, vmmpos, ch_exp, phase)
    - [x] Could be wrong: Delimiter (level1Id % 100) was missed?
      - `decodedData->Draw("level1Id : Entry$ >> (400, 21999.5, 22399.5, 102, -1.5, 100.5)", "Entry$ >= 22000 && Entry$ < 22400", "colz")`
      - www.cern.ch/tuna/2020_07_16_artphase.png looks ok
      - DELIMITER: ent, level1Id = 21900, 0.0
      - DELIMITER: ent, level1Id = 22000, 0.0
      - DELIMITER: ent, level1Id = 22100, 0.0
      - DELIMITER: ent, level1Id = 22200, 0.0
      - Fatal error: (0, 16, 60, 14) not in hits. Bad.
      - looks ok
    - [x] Could be wrong: pattern json formatting incorrectly?
    - [x] Conclusion: data looks weird. Board vs L1ID isnt diagonal! Off-diagonal entries confuse the script (as they should).
    - [x] Action: loud warning instead of crashing when this happens. Skip the data events which dont make sense.
