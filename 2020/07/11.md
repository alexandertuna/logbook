### Todo

- [ ] BB5 ALTI
  - [ ] Reference: NSWPartitionMaker/191A-Calib-MMTP
  - [ ] Relevant files:
    - [ ] daq/schema/alti.schema.xml (diff)
    - [ ] daq/sw/alti_sw.data.xml (unchanged relative to PM)
    - [ ] part-XXX.data.xml (possible diff: <obj class="MasterTrigger" id="AltiMasterTrigger">)
      - Should be okay. Defined in NSWAlti.data.xml
    - [ ] NSW-Alti-BB5.data.xml
      - Not a small number of diffs! But tractable.
      - Some BCR/custom_BCR diffs: not relevant I think
      - TTC_L1A_source: relevant (in class=AltiBoard)
      - ECR_periodic: not relevant
      - AltiModeAltiMaster: not relevant
      - AltiPatternGeneratorConfig: not relevant
  - [ ] diff between current schema and l1ct-08-03-03 schema?
