  - [x] I think it would be good if you can mention right in the beginning that we have on one hand the system slice tests, which will be fullfilled when demonstrated for a single sector, and on the other hand the commissioning operations that are part of every single of the 2x16 sectors.
  - [x] can you remind people on the definition of stage-0 ?
  - [x] slide 6, I think you should be more explicit, was it successful ? was it verified that the candidate had the expected format ? .....
  - [x] slide 8: what about duplicate removal ? The example you show, for me at least, does not allow any conclusion on this ...
  - [ ] slide 9: again, can you state specific what indeed was proven ? The slide as reads now for me does not really tell if this test was only attempted, or also successful
  - [x] slide 13, the JTAG link, will this be needed for every sector also in the future ?
  - [ ] slide 19, please expect the question what of the latency was actually measured already; if not the full path, then at least what parts ?  second, for the stage-0, the 963 ns, does this refer to the output to the SL ? Ie, is this the number to compare to trhe 1075 budget ?
  - [x] and, stage-0 here does include the MM ?
  - [x] general, what is the status of the TP readout ? Will this be covered by George I. ? If not, can you add it, incl. to what level of rate it was tested, etc. ?
