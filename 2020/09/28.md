    - [ ] Milestone: 1 sector of synchronous trigger electronics
      - [ ] Only possible in 191
      - [ ] Global synchronization of PT, MM TP, sTGC TP
      - [ ] Adjustable BCID offsets, and synchronization FIFO for first-arriving-trigger
    - [ ] Method: synchronous test pulse, and observe TP output
      - [ ] 1 ALTI feeding 3 FELIX
      - [ ] 24 pFEB, 128 MMFE8, 16 ADDC, 24 sTGC L1DDC, 16 MMFE8 L1DDC, 1 pad trigger, 1 TP
    - [ ] Results: synchronized triggers
      - [ ] Waveform included
      - [ ] BCIDs synchronized
      - [ ] sTGC and MM triggers arrive same time
      - [ ] sTGC and MM triggers merged
    - [ ] Addendum: updated required to synchronization
      - [ ] OCR signal treated differently in shared FPGA firmware vs ASICs
      - [ ] Firmware updated, will retest to confirm
  - [ ] send draft to LoL tonight
