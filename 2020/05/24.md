### Todo

- [ ] Make outlines for undergrad summer projects

## Proposals

### MM cosmics: GDAC tracking

- [ ] Big picture: further develop BB5 cosmic tracking
- [ ] Existing code: [bb5_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/anwang/bb5_analysis)
- [ ] Active developers: Gabriel, Anne(?), Alex
- [ ] Understand why large-angle tracks (xz or yz) are chosen by algorithm
- [ ] Add gap between SM1 and SM2, and find tracks traversing both modules
- [ ] Propose how to better incorporate stereo strips (xz -> xyz)
- [ ] Make code more approachable for newbies
- [ ] Present thorough review of algorithm to BB5 analysis group
- [ ] Negatives
   - [ ] "Fun part" already exists and works pretty well
   - [ ] Counter: Tracking is fun. Extending to 3D is fun.

### MM cosmics: Understanding chi2/ndf

- [ ] Big picture: understand physics of chi2/ndf and tracks in BB5 cosmics
- [ ] Existing code: [bb5_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/anwang/bb5_analysis)
- [ ] Active developers: Gabriel, Anne(?), Alex
- [ ] Understand what chi2/ndf distribution should look like from first principles and/or toy MC
- [ ] Make chi2/ndf for 6, 7, 8-hit tracks separately
- [ ] Show chi2/ndf behavior for different uncertainties considered
- [ ] Check chi2/ndf behavior for dependencies (e.g. track angle, time)
- [ ] All work done in consultation with ongoing studies of position resolution
- [ ] Present thorough description of chi2/ndf to BB5 analysis group
- [ ] Negatives
   - [ ] Narrow scope
   - [ ] Counter: chi2 is pretty important in physics


### Combining MM and sTGC information: 191 cosmics

- [ ] Combining MM and sTGC information: 191 cosmics
- [ ] Existing code: [nsw_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-muon-nsw-tools/nsw_analysis)
- [ ] Active developers: Heather (related: Gabriel, Anne(?), Alex)
- [ ] Understand and run nsw_analysis on existing 191 cosmic data (limited amount of data)
- [ ] Design tracking for MM strips, sTGC strips
- [ ] Design tracking for MM strips, sTGC strips, sTGC pads
- [ ] Test tracking algorithm with 191 cosmic data as available
- [ ] Present review of algorithm and results to 191 group
- [ ] Negatives
   - [ ] Not much data has been recorded in 191
   - [ ] Harvard 191 involvement is much smaller than Harvard BB5 involvement
   - [ ] Counter: 191 is hot :fire: and plans to resume in July

### Combining MM and sTGC information: track fit (sim)

- [ ] Existing code: [oct_sim](https://github.com/sezata/oct_sim)
- [ ] Active developers: None

### Combining MM and sTGC information: trigger decision (sim)

- [ ] Existing code: [oct_sim](https://github.com/sezata/oct_sim)
- [ ] Active developers: None (should ask John to confirm)

### Dealing with MM TP duplicates

- [ ] Existing code: [oct_sim](https://github.com/sezata/oct_sim)
- [ ] Active developers: None. (related: Nathan, Alex)
- [ ] Recreate Ann's plots of N(duplicates)
- [ ] Understand performance as a function of road size and overlap size
   - [ ] N(duplicates)
   - [ ] Signal efficiency and resolution
   - [ ] Background rejection
- [ ] Propose how to avoid, or deal with, duplicates
   - [ ] From first principles
   - [ ] FPGA-friendly approach?
   - [ ] FPGA-friendly approximation?
- [ ] Negatives
   - [ ] Narrow focus
   - [ ] May not have tractable solution which is practical for FPGA
