### Todo

- [ ] Make outlines for undergrad summer projects
   - [ ] MM cosmics: GDAC tracking
      - [ ] Existing code: [bb5_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/anwang/bb5_analysis)
      - [ ] Active developers: Gabriel, Anne(?), Alex
      - [ ] Understand why large-angle tracks (xz or yz) are chosen by algorithm
      - [ ] Add gap between SM1 and SM2, and find tracks traversing both modules
      - [ ] Propose how to better incorporate stereo strips (xz -> xyz)
      - [ ] Make code more approachable for newbies
      - [ ] Present thorough review of algorithm to BB5 analysis group
      - [ ] Negatives
         - [ ] "Fun part" already exists and works pretty well
         - [ ] Counter: Tracking is fun. Extending to 3D is fun.
   - [ ] MM cosmics: Understanding the chi2/ndf and features
      - [ ] Existing code: [bb5_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/anwang/bb5_analysis)
      - [ ] Active developers: Gabriel, Anne(?), Alex
      - [ ] Understand what chi2/ndf distribution should look like from first principles and/or toy MC
      - [ ] Make chi2/ndf for 6, 7, 8-hit tracks separately
      - [ ] Show chi2/ndf behavior for different uncertainties considered
      - [ ] Check chi2/ndf behavior for dependencies (e.g. track angle, time)
      - [ ] All work done in consultation with ongoing studies of position resolution
      - [ ] Present thorough description of chi2/ndf to BB5 analysis group
      - [ ] Negatives
         - [ ] Narrow scope
         - [ ] Counter: chi2 is pretty important in physics
   - [ ] Combining MM and sTGC information: 191 cosmics
      - [ ] Existing code: [nsw_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-muon-nsw-tools/nsw_analysis)
      - [ ] Active developers: Heather (related: Gabriel, Anne(?), Alex)
      - [ ] Understand and run nsw_analysis on existing 191 cosmic data (limited amount of data)
      - [ ] Design tracking for MM strips, sTGC strips
      - [ ] Design tracking for MM strips, sTGC strips, sTGC pads
      - [ ] Test tracking algorithm with 191 cosmic data as available
      - [ ] Present review of algorithm and results to 191 group
      - [ ] Negatives
         - [ ] Not much data has been recorded in 191
         - [ ] Harvard 191 involvement is much smaller than Harvard BB5 involvement
         - [ ] Counter: 191 is hot :fire: and plans to resume in July
   - [ ] Combining MM and sTGC information: track fit (sim)
      - [ ] Existing code: [oct_sim](https://github.com/sezata/oct_sim)

      - [ ] Existing code: [oct_sim](https://github.com/sezata/oct_sim)
      - [ ] Active developers: None (should ask John to confirm)
   - [ ] Dealing with MM TP duplicates
      - [ ] Existing code: [oct_sim](https://github.com/sezata/oct_sim)
      - [ ] Active developers: None. (related: Nathan, Alex)
      - [ ] Recreate Ann's plots of N(duplicates)
      - [ ] Understand algorithm as a function of road size and overlap size
         - [ ] N(duplicates)
         - [ ] Signal efficiency and resolution
         - [ ] Background rejection
      - [ ] Propose how to avoid, or deal with, duplicates

         - [ ] FPGA-friendly approach?
         - [ ] FPGA-friendly approximation?
      - [ ] Negatives
         - [ ] Narrow focus
         - [ ] May not have tractable solution which is practical for FPGA
