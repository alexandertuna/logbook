### Todo

- [ ] Make outlines for undergrad summer projects
   - [ ] MM cosmics: GDAC tracking
      - [ ] Existing code: [bb5_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/anwang/bb5_analysis)
      - [ ] Add gap between SM1 and SM2, and find tracks traversing both modules
      - [ ] Propose how to better incorporate stereo strips (xz -> xyz)
      - [ ] Make code more approachable for newbies
      - [ ] Present thorough review of algorithm to BB5 analysis group
   - [ ] MM cosmics: Understanding the chi2/ndf and features
      - [ ] Existing code: [bb5_analysis](https://gitlab.cern.ch/anwang/bb5_analysis)
      - [ ] Understand what chi2/ndf distribution should look like from first principles and/or toy MC
      - [ ] Make chi2/ndf for 6, 7, 8-hit tracks separately
      - [ ] Show chi2/ndf behavior for different uncertainties considered
      - [ ] Check chi2/ndf behavior for dependencies (e.g. track angle, time)
   - [ ] Combining MM and sTGC information: track fit (sim)
   - [ ] Combining MM and sTGC information: trigger decision (sim)
   - [ ] Dealing with MM TP duplicates
