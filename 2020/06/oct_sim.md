- General
  - Nice
  - `// Input: // Output:`
  - Please no tabs, stick to spaces
  - Have you made plot of efficiency? I worry
  - I generally like to separate histogram-making from histogram-plotting
    - Making: C++
    - Plotting: python
    - But you're in charge
  - Feels like a big dump of plotting stuff
    - Think of future-Anthony
  - Strongly support moving away from using cout for anything
    - Put everything into root file / TTree / TH1
- `include/ChamberUtilities.hh`
  - Why `struct slope_t` and `bool compare_slope` here? Not really chamber-related. Better for `Finder.hh`?
- `HttStyles` lmao
