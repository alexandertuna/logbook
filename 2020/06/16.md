- [ ] PChang blurb
  - I'd like to introduce our speaker today, Philip Chang. Philip was awarded his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2017, where he worked on the ATLAS experiment at CERN. I remember him fondly as a major player in the first measurement of Higgs boson decays to WW. Philip worked especially on vector-boson fusion Higgs production, which was one of the first ATLAS Higgs measurements to rely on machine learning, which was very cool and exciting at the time. 
  - Now, Philip is a postdoc at UCSD, where he's been since 2017, having switched to the CMS experiment. As a postdoc, he has worked on developing parallelizable tracking algorithms for the future of the experiment, and he has been one of the driving forces of triboson physics at the LHC, which I hope sounds familiar to some people in the audience, since Harvard worked on triboson physics for the ATLAS experiment. Today, he'll tell us about exactly that: an exciting new triboson result from the CMS experiment. Please, Philip, take it away.
