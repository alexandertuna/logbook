- [ ] Galaxus
  - [ ] Deodorant
  - [ ] Socks

    - /afs/cern.ch/work/t/tuna/public/nswcal/nswdaq/NSWCalibration/

    - Good concept? Probably
  - [x] Can you pass the calib object to this function
    - [x] Instead of attrs of the object
    - [x] Or, maybe better, make `calib` a member variable
    - [x] WIP MR!
