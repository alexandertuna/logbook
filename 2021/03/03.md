- [x] Mention to Nathan
  - [x] Whats better: manual channel masking or auto VMM masking?
  - [x] Short term: auto-masking I think
  - [x] Isn't this L1A design really sensitive to noise? Can we e.g. set upper limit on latency?
  - [x] It is bad for secondary components (L1A) to drive primary components (VMM mask)
  - [x] <del>Why does L1A data look bananas sometimes (multiple L1A in window probably)</del>
  - [x] Is it possible for TP to tell us how often VMM is masked? 1%, 10%, 100%?
    - [x] Very informative to make post-run "this is efficiency of masking for this run"
- [x] ozo letter
  - [x] One sentence per bullet svp
  - [x] Does OZ want me to mention anything specific?
  - [x] Paused!
- [x] Send ART counters to AAron

  - [x] What CL args need to be added?
- [x] TP configuration for cosmics
  - [x] Adjust the cosmic json with the parameters used on Monday
    - [x] Window
    - [x] Left
    - [x] Right
  - [x] Add options in sendTpConfig
    - [x] Set self-trigger latency
    - [x] Mask TP? Nah, not for now
