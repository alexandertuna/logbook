- [ ] Mention to Nathan
  - [ ] Whats better: manual channel masking or auto VMM masking?
  - [ ] Short term: auto-masking I think
  - [ ] Isn't this L1A design really sensitive to noise? Can we e.g. set upper limit on latency?
  - [ ] It is bad for inessential components (L1A) to drive essential components (VMM mask)
  - [ ] Why does L1A data look bananas sometimes (multiple L1A in window probably)
  - [ ] Is it possible for TP to tell us how often VMM is masked? 1%, 10%, 100%?
- [ ] ozo letter
  - [ ] One sentence per bullet svp
  - [ ] Does OZ want me to mention anything specific?
- [ ] A16 sTGC
